# Commits

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in order to automatically define
versions and create a [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md). THis will help us keep a better overview of what
has changed over time or was added in the last version.

## Writing commits

All commits are linted, so you will not be able to commit until your message follows our rules.
Please read [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to get a better
understanding on why this is helpful and how this works. You can also look at
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) if you are interested in more detail about versioning.

### Good commit messages

A good commit message is important for us for several reasons

1. Make use of automatic [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/)
2. Generate a change [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)
3. Give contributors a chance to easily understand what has been done

In general the following rule applies:

> Keep messages short and concise.
